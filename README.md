# Hi, I’m Frank 👋

IT security professional, open-source advocate, endurance runner, and indie game developer behind [WASDCAT Games](https://www.wasdcat.com).

I work at the intersection of security, software engineering, and IT operations.  
By day, I focus on information security, risk management, and resilient systems.  
By night (and on weekends), I build games based on the Godot engine.

As a balance to my professional work, I am dedicated to endurance running.  
Since 2019, I am a World Marathon Majors 6 Star Finisher, and since 2025 a SuperHalfs Finisher.
